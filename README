=== What the hell it is ===
It's a simple gong for my classes so that teachers are reminded to take time
for much deserved breaks between classes.

=== How the hell to use it ===
Make sure you have installed SFML, Boost and a recent version of GCC.
If you have those prerequisites, just do "make" and hope real hard.
In case it compiled nicely, do "./MegaGong.bin" and enjoy the numbers.

=== License ===
The code is GPLv3.
